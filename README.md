Hotel Reservations SQL Project: Comprehensive Analysis
This project is designed to analyze hotel reservation data using SQL, providing insights into key business metrics and customer behaviors. By leveraging SQL queries and commands, we aim to answer critical questions related to hotel bookings, cancellations, customer preferences, and overall hotel performance. The dataset is explored to uncover trends and patterns that can help hotels optimize their booking strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

Project Components:
Problem Statements:

A structured document outlining various analytical questions related to hotel reservations.
These problem statements serve as the foundation for data exploration and help identify key areas of analysis, such as booking trends, cancellation rates, seasonal demand fluctuations, and customer demographics.
Hotel Reservation Dataset:

A CSV file containing extensive hotel reservation details, including attributes such as booking status, number of adults and children, number of weekend and weekday stays, type of meal plans, room categories, lead times, special requests, and more.
This dataset provides a rich source of information for data-driven decision-making.
SQL Solutions:

A well-structured SQL script containing queries and commands executed in MySQL Workbench.
These queries are used to analyze and answer the problem statements, including data extraction, aggregation, filtering, and advanced SQL techniques like joins, subqueries, and window functions.
